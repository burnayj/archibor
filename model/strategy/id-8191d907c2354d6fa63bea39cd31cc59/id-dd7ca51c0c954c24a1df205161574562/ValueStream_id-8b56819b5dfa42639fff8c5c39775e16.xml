    documentation="The collective term „polyolefins“ embraces all types of plastics deriving from the polymerisation process.&#xD;&#xA;The polyolefins manufactured by Borealis form the basis of many plastics products that are an intrinsic part of our daily lives. The areas of application are wide-ranging and diverse. At Borealis, these areas are divided into the main segments:&#xD;&#xA;– Energy&#xD;&#xA;– Infrastructure&#xD;&#xA;– Mobility&#xD;&#xA;– Consumer Products&#xD;&#xA;– Healthcare&#xD;&#xA;– Polyolefin Solutions&#xD;&#xA;– Circular Economy Solutions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Polyolefin is a type of polymer material made from monomers containing only carbon and hydrogen. It is used in a wide range of applications, including packaging, consumer goods, automotive parts, and construction materials, due to its high strength, versatility, and durability. The most common polyolefins are polyethylene and polypropylene. They are produced through a polymerization process that uses catalysts to link monomer molecules into long chains."/>
