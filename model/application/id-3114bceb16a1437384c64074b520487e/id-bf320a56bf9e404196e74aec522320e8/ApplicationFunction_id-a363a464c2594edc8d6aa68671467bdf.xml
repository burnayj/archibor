    documentation="The inventory management function of LIMS is an essential part of a laboratory â€˜s day-to-day management. A LIMS manages stock supplies and reagents. A LIMS can also generate automatic reorder alerts in case of stock depletion. These alerts facilitate laboratory workflows and prevent any delays resulting from the unavailability of stocks. A LIMS can also help to keep detailed and up-to-date information about your equipment and notify when any equipment is due for upgrade or maintenance."/>
